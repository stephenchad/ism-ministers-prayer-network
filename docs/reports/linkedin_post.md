Excited to share a project I recently developed: the ISM Ministers Prayer Network, a global community platform for ministers.

This was a comprehensive project that involved designing and building a secure, scalable, and feature-rich web application from the ground up. It was a fantastic opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world setting and deliver a product that connects users from around the world.

**Key Project Features & Technical Skills:**

- **Full-Stack Development**: Leveraged a **Laravel** & **PHP** backend with a **MySQL** database, all built on a clean **MVC architecture**. The frontend was developed with the **Blade** templating engine and optimized with **Vite**.

- **Comprehensive Public-Facing Portal**: Developed a rich user experience with multiple content hubs:
    - **Media Streaming**: Integrated live streaming and online radio features.
    - **Resource Libraries**: Created dedicated sections for video, prayer, and music resources.
    - **Community Information**: Built dynamic pages for news, events, programs, and coordinator directories.

- **Secure Membership & Authentication**: Implemented a complete user management system:
    - Secure registration, login, and password management.
    - User profile customization, including profile picture and personal information updates.

- **Interactive Community Platform**: Engineered a core feature allowing members to form and manage their own communities:
    - **Group Creation & Management**: Users can create, join, and manage prayer groups.
    - **Private Group Interaction**: Each group has a private discussion board and the ability to share group-specific events, photos, and resources.

- **Advanced Administrative Control Panel**: Built a secure, full-featured backend dashboard giving administrators complete control over the platform:
    - **User Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for all users.
    - **Content Management**: Admins can manage all site content, including news, events, testimonies, and media.
    - **Community Oversight**: Full administrative control over all user-created groups.

I am proud of the result and confident in the skills I've demonstrated in building a full-stack application. I am actively seeking new opportunities in the **USA** or **UK** where I can contribute to a forward-thinking team and continue to grow as a developer.
